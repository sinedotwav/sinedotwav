<h4>Story</h4>
	
	<p> I grew up borne to a life of poverty as yolk from a trailer park in Montana. My memories from the simple childhood are fond ones. I still remember 
	much of the visual scenery from events that dotted throughout my experience in that limited, yet seemlying neverending, world. Even though my parents 
	set boundaries to what I could explore, I found that I could explore everything within those limits to an unboundless extent. Everything can be explored
	and thought about to an unlimited degree. I found myself looking beyond the barriers set in my childhood, not quite bored of the things within it, but excited
	to see the limitlessness that lied beyond it. </p>
	
	<p> After the Age of 5, I was moved from my Montana life to a Portland one. I grew up here, and have integrated into it's lifestyle. I understand it fully,
	and love living here. Portland has given me both well-being and grief, starting with my Mother's divorce of my father, and her independent journey here. 
	Being raised to a single mother was a pleasant experience, even if archiaic, I found peace in both cycles of prosperity and poverity. At a young age I found
	that single mothers are subject to an imaginable about of hostility, as my own family turned against her, with rumormongering and scorn. My mother lost her 
	finger to a staff infection, and her job to her health. Soon, I watched my mother lose her mind, consumed by a state of paranoia and insecurity. Looking for
	employment, my mother was victim to a car accident. Come twelve, my life struck horrid, and I had lost my mother. </p>
	
	<p>At the end of harmony, came discord. My father had moved to Portland long ago to be closer to us. He found the opportunity to claim me and my brother as 
	dependents, even if my mother had always planned for us to live with our uncle. None of the family had a problem with our father as the caretaker. I remember 
	the funeral. Everyone looked like they cared, people put money into the box. Relatives and friends came to collect things... valuables... and our mother's
	jewelry as keepsakes to remember her by. Neither my brother or my youthful mind could grasp what was happening to us. Things we used to see everyday ended
	up dissapearing; our mother, her house, her things all went missing as the grown-ups knew where to put them. If we were to look back and wonder what happened,
	why would we miss stuff so girly and unnecessary to us? Our life as children under a mom's watch was over, we were to ascend into manhood.</p>
	
	<p> Our next house is an iconic slum, worthy of being a hallmark or a poster-child of the 2009 housing crash. If America is to be a nation of renters, we became
	one of the first in the generation. My father has proven to be a disappointment, who has clumbsly managed his and our funds into the dust. He is worse with money
	than he is picking up the clothes off of the floor. My father was
	also stuck with constant unemployment benefits, and our passed mother's social security. The lucky guy 
	found himself without the burdern to pay child-support any longer, or the initiative to look after us at all. We had much more freedom under him, and through that I 
	learned a lot about the world beyond past boundaries. I had found out to take my own initiative. </p> 
	
	<img src="http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/14c1e01e0ba2843528103824ab82d5ca.gif" alt="dead leaves gif" class="float" />
	
	<p>Having no longer a college fund, a house, or a parent, I found college to be an unlikely prospect. Public highschool bored me as much as the people in it.
	I almost failed all my classes at the end of it, even if I had good attendance. I was focused on learning in calculus and simply listening to my teachers lectures.
	I never took an ACT or an SAT. With newfound initiative, I joined the Navy, hoping to find an international perspective and person. The Navy tested me under their ASVAB
	program, which is an information test sectioned by subject, and included with an IQ test. I honestly don't know what metrics the test uses, or how they determine
	the final score, but I tested into a 92. The score contrasted well with my apparent 130 IQ, and the Navy Nuclear recruiter enlisted me under the Navy Nuke program.</p>
	
	<p>The Navy found itself to be more discord than anything I experienced before. I still can't believe the things I've seen there. I am definitely glad to be
	back, and proud of my uncategorized medical discharge. You can find my full story <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p> Harmory and discord have both found places in my life, and I am grateful for both. I hope to experience more of life, all of it, or as much of it I can. </p>

<h4>Story</h4>
	
	<p> I grew up borne to a life of poverty as yolk from a trailer park in Montana. My memories from the simple childhood are fond ones. I still remember 
	much of the visual scenery from events that dotted throughout my experience in that limited, yet seemlying neverending, world. Even though my parents 
	set boundaries to what I could explore, I found that I could explore everything within those limits to an unboundless extent. Everything can be explored
	and thought about to an unlimited degree. I found myself looking beyond the barriers set in my childhood, not quite bored of the things within it, but excited
	to see the limitlessness that lied beyond it. </p>
	
	<p> After the Age of 5, I was moved from my Montana life to a Portland one. I grew up here, and have integrated into it's lifestyle. I understand it fully,
	and love living here. Portland has given me both well-being and grief, starting with my Mother's divorce of my father, and her independent journey here. 
	Being raised to a single mother was a pleasant experience, even if archiaic, I found peace in both cycles of prosperity and poverity. At a young age I found
	that single mothers are subject to an imaginable about of hostility, as my own family turned against her, with rumormongering and scorn. My mother lost her 
	finger to a staff infection, and her job to her health. Soon, I watched my mother lose her mind, consumed by a state of paranoia and insecurity. Looking for
	employment, my mother was victim to a car accident. Come twelve, my life struck horrid, and I had lost my mother. </p>
	
	<p>At the end of harmony, came discord. My father had moved to Portland long ago to be closer to us. He found the opportunity to claim me and my brother as 
	dependents, even if my mother had always planned for us to live with our uncle. None of the family had a problem with our father as the caretaker. I remember 
	the funeral. Everyone looked like they cared, people put money into the box. Relatives and friends came to collect things... valuables... and our mother's
	jewelry as keepsakes to remember her by. Neither my brother or my youthful mind could grasp what was happening to us. Things we used to see everyday ended
	up dissapearing; our mother, her house, her things all went missing as the grown-ups knew where to put them. If we were to look back and wonder what happened,
	why would we miss stuff so girly and unnecessary to us? Our life as children under a mom's watch was over, we were to ascend into manhood.</p>
	
	<p> Our next house is an iconic slum, worthy of being a hallmark or a poster-child of the 2009 housing crash. If America is to be a nation of renters, we became
	one of the first in the generation. My father has proven to be a disappointment, who has clumbsly managed his and our funds into the dust. He is worse with money
	than he is picking up the clothes off of the floor. My father was
	also stuck with constant unemployment benefits, and our passed mother's social security. The lucky guy 
	found himself without the burdern to pay child-support any longer, or the initiative to look after us at all. We had much more freedom under him, and through that I 
	learned a lot about the world beyond past boundaries. I had found out to take my own initiative. </p>
